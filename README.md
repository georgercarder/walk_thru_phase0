#### Eth 2.0: A walk through Phase 0

// LINK means "TODO put link here"

// introduction
 
// niceties, vague outline
 
// my approach - learn by doing
 
// vague description that I'll be setting up nodes and describing their roles
 
// my opinions
 
// looking forward

With the /* TODO HUMAN SOUNDING ADJECTIVES explaining leadup */ of various beacon-chain testnets LINK we were curious to get a hands-on introduction to the various entities in the Eth 2.0 protocol LINK. There is a great deal written online about Eth 2.0 LINK and facets of its various phases so we figure the simplest way to get a view into Phase 0 of this upgrade is to just follow our nose and trace the interations of some existing clients. 

This is an Ethereum LINK blog, so we assume the reader is familiar with Ethereum as a platform as well as the motivation for the upgrade to Eth 2.0. If not, checkout these links LINK to get up to speed.

// rough outline of upgrade and phases here TODO

Our goal is to learn about each node in this upgrade. We'll do this by building and running the respective software, describing its role in this phase (Phase 0) and the ultimate role-out (Phase 2), and actually tracing its interactions within the system.
